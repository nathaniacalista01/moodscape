      "Reflecting on all of this recently has got me thinking about how crucial growth is for each and every one of us, and how we should embrace that every day.We start to grow taller from when we are little - that’s growth we can see. But it’s actually the growth we can’t see that’s more important. The growth during school when we’re becoming the person we’re supposed to be. The growth during university and work, where we’re becoming independent. And the continuous growth throughout our lives where we get to understand who we are.So today, I wanted to share with you, not only why this is important - but also some small things you can do every single day that will help you see your growth.",
